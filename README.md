# Arithmatic
Welcome to the magic of number-crunching! Arithmatic is a math-based puzzle game where you need to create equations based on the target numbers given using all 10 single-digits numbers as well as operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.

There are two game modes including:

ARCADE MODE: You have 30 seconds to reach a particular target number in the least amount of equations possible. The faster you create equations, the higher your score. 

SURVIVAL MODE: Get each target number within one move. The more equations you create, the more experience you get. By gaining experience, you can increase your level, which helps to increase the number of points you get for creating equations.

TIMED MODES: Want to test yourself to see how well you do within a specified amount of time? Set the time limit to 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes for both Arcade and Survival Modes.

NEW! LEADERBOARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: Compete against your friends and everyone around the world to become the champion of Mathematics! Complete various achievements to reach this goal!
